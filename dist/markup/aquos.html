However,it is difficult to simply solve the problems of global warming and climate change. Education is the key, and it is important to begin at a young age.</p></div><div class="small-12 medium-8 columns"><h6>The Solution</h6><p class="col-2">Most aquaponic tanks are geared towards keeping either plants or fish alive, but not both. Fish tanks are hard to clean, require a lot of maintenance, and regular upkeep to make sure fish are healthy. Aquos is more than a decorative fish tank. It aims to inspire young children and adults to care for their environment and learn how the interactions between animals and plants fuel life. Children can learn about sustainability while having a less stressful system for families to own and enjoy pet fish. This partner project was completed in a month. I conducted research, form studies, ideated, made sketch models, and rendered the final product.
